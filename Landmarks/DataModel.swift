            name: "India Gate",
            about: "The India Gate (formerly known as All India War Memorial) is a war memorial located near the Rajpath (officially called Kartavya Path) on the eastern edge of the ceremonial axis of New Delhi. It stands as a memorial to 74,187 soldiers of the Indian Army who died between 1914 and 1921 in the First World War, in France, Flanders, Mesopotamia, Persia, East Africa, Gallipoli and elsewhere in the Near and the Far East, and the Third Anglo-Afghan War. 13,300 servicemen's names, including some soldiers and officers from the United Kingdom, are inscribed on the gate. Designed by Edwin Lutyens, the gate evokes the architectural style of the ancient Roman triumphal arches, such as the Arch of Constantine in Rome, and later memorial arches; it is often compared to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, and the Gateway of India in Mumbai.",

            about: "The Red Fort, also known as Lal Qila, is a historic fort in Old Delhi that served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors for nearly 200 years. Built by Emperor Shah Jahan in 1648 when he shifted his capital from Agra to Delhi, the fort is named for its massive enclosing walls of red sandstone. The fort complex showcases the pinnacle of Mughal creativity which, under Shah Jahan, brought together architectural traditions from Islamic, Persian, Timurid, and Hindu architectural styles. The fort's planning and aesthetics represent the zenith of Mughal architecture. It was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007 and remains an important symbol of India's sovereignty, with the Prime Minister hoisting the national flag here every Independence Day.",
